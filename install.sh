# mu-commander dependency installer.
#
# Detects which of the tools README.md documents (Installation -> 2.
# Dependencies) resolve on PATH and installs only the ones that are missing:
#
#   - system tools (bash, git, tmux, jq, gh, coreutils pieces, sed, grep,
#     awk, tar) through the first package manager on PATH: apt-get, dnf,
#     pacman, or Homebrew — prefixed with sudo only when the effective user
#     is not root and sudo is available (never for brew);
#   - treehouse from its official GitHub release (latest tag, sha256-checked
#     against the release's checksums.txt) into ~/.local/bin;
#   - pi through the npm command pi's own README documents;
#   - shellcheck by delegating to scripts/worktree-setup.sh, the single
#     pinned source of truth for that dependency — this script deliberately
#     declares no shellcheck version or checksum of its own.
#
# Besides dependencies, every run also mirrors the required skills
# (required-skills/ -> .agents/skills/ through scripts/sync-skills.sh) and
# activates the repository's versioned git hooks (core.hooksPath ->
# .githooks, set only when unset, never over a foreign value). Both are
# advisory: they report problems as warnings and never change the exit
# status, which stays tied to PATH dependencies only (specs/skills-sync-hook).
#
# Idempotent and non-destructive: an existing tool is never overwritten,
# every skip is a visible per-tool manual hint, the run ends with a summary
# (installed / already present / needs manual action), and the exit status
# is 0 only when every required dependency resolves on PATH at the end.
